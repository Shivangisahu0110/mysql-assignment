    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of that data. Databases are used to store various types of information, ranging from simple lists to complex data structures, and are a fundamental component of many software applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two broad categories of database management systems, each with its own characteristics and use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) to define, manage, and manipulate data. These databases store data in tables with rows and columns, and the relationships between different tables are established through keys (usually primary and foreign keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema that defines the structure of the data before data entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL databases are a diverse group of databases that do not rely on a fixed schema and are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer high scalability and performance, making them suitable for applications with rapidly changing requirements and large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema : NoSQL databases allow for dynamic schema changes, making it easier to adapt to evolving data needs.\n",
    "Scalability: These databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing them to handle massive amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types: There are several types of NoSQL databases, including document stores, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB (document store), Cassandra (column-family store), Redis (key-value store), Neo4j (graph database).\n",
